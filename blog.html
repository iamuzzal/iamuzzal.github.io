                                Technology is the application of tools, materials and knowledge to 
						solve problems and extend human capabilities. Technology is one of 
						the most controversial issues in our current society. New technology 
						always changes our life very much and takes it to a new level. It is 
						like the new way of thinking or doing the normal things differently, 
						better and much more faster with less hassle and at a much affordable 
						rate. Modern technology has made it possible for the discovery of many 
						multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. With 
						all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, 
						faster, better and more fun. Technology can affect life both positively and negatively.
						<h2>Positive impacts</h2>
						Technology has changed the way we learn and learn. In the past, 
						we were not able to get the flexibility of data, information and 
						knowledge. The school was very far from home. But today, due to technology, 
						there are online schools. Anyone can do online degrees using the internet 
						and computers. Today, we have mobile, internet, computer and social media 
						content, video conferencing tools, and mobile applications to communicate 
						with anyone from anywhere in the world <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">was impossible in the past. The 
						advantage of communication exchange is the fast, easy and fastest 
						communication method. Technology brings families closer even when they live 
						far apart. Technology can never take the place of real kisses and hugs, but 
						it can enable loved ones to see each other and speak to each other, even when 
						they live on different continents.
						<h2>Negative Impacts</h2>
						Vast use of technology is likely to result in poor social skills. 
						Business meetings are held over Skype and kids chat in messenger rather 
						than meet up with a friend in person. On the face of it, technology appears 
						to create global network bringing people together. But in fact, this 
						replaces real-life communication and ends in social isolation. Moreover, 
						strong social bonds are replaced with a number of shallow “friends” in social 
						networks. As a result, people might feel lonely and depressed.Among the most 
						dangerous effects of technology is obesity. Being absorbed by a laptop or a 
						tablet, people tend to snack a lot, keep late hours and exercise less. The 
						more time you sit in front of the PC, the lesser is the blood circulation in 
						your body, not to speak of the neck and head pain. Moreover, sedentary life 
						is the reason why many people have a curved backbone and bad posture as a result.
